        <h1>Indie animation<br></h1>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>As we all know- or so I hope- that animation was <u>first created in the 1830s</u> with animated films first being made in the <u>late 1800s.</u></p>
        <p>When it first came around we needed expensive equipment to make animations, they had high budgets and large teams spending years to make a movie. No one could do it on their own.<br> People started making their own animations, <strong>indie animation</strong>, in the early 2000s. </p>
        <p> With the rise of youtube and more accessible access to the internet came animation. People couldn't make money off of it until youtube started doing ad monitization and small animators gained popularity. Animations take quite some time to make so unfortunatly most creators couldn't hit the length requirement to be paid. In this time though <u>storytime</u> animators came around, telling stories kept the love of animation up on youtube.</p>
        <h2>The golden age</h2>
        <p> Around 2019 a lady called Vivian Medrano made and started producing a show called <u>'Hazbin hotel'</u> which quickly gained popularity, getting picked up by amazon and having a full season produced in January 2024. Through this time she also produced a show called <u>'Helluva Boss'</u> in the same universe to keep popularity up. Regardless of people's opinion on her and her shows, she opened up the flood gates for indie animation. Since her debuet, we have had countless shows being produced indepenantly like <u>'Murder Drones', 'The Amazing Digital Circus', 'lackadaisy', etc</u> With indie animation creaters produce shows freely, often for a specific demographic. They don't have to worry about angering shareholders or getting their show canceled. They can keep their stories alive. Althouhgh many people refer to this as the golden age because so much is being produced and there is so much love. I hope that this is currently more of a bronze age, so we can keep producing and reach indie animation to new levels. So we can keep improving. </p>
